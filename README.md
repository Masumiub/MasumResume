# About Me

Hi! I'm Masum Musfique ‚Äî a passionate and detail-oriented Full-Stack Web Developer based in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I truly enjoy building clean, responsive user interfaces that not only look good but also feel intuitive. I‚Äôve worked on a range of personal and collaborative projects using React, JavaScript, DaisyUI, and Firebase Authentication. I‚Äôm also confident working with backend technologies like Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, giving me a full-picture understanding of modern web development.

Outside of programming, I have a creative side ‚Äî I love painting and graphic design. These hobbies help me think visually and bring a strong sense of aesthetics to my UI work. Whether it's designing a smooth user flow or selecting the perfect color palette, I enjoy blending creativity with code.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
